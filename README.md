# React Playground

This is a simple private project aimed at teaching myself React and refreshing my knowledge of TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. The created website serves no specific purpose as it consists of intentionally poorly designed form elements.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/KubaBubaB/React-Playground
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd React-Playground
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```

Website should be available under ***localhost:3000***


## Examples

#### Pick your phone number :)
Have you ever wanted to annoy your future customers and make them spend more time on registration? If so, look no further! Import the *Wheel* component and simply insert the tag:
```javascript
<WheelNumberPicker />
```
where you want your phone number selection to be. Modify the modal within the "WheelNumberPicker.tsx" file and retrieve your customers' numbers with the **numbers** variable!

#### Unsubscribe from newsletter :)
Do your customers hate your newsletter? Worry not! Import the *RunningButton* ccomponent and insert the tag 
```javascript
<ButtonRun />
```
where you want your Unsubscribe button to be. Adjust the css parameters, make few changes in the modal and **Voil√†** - no more unsubscribes from your *lovely* ~~spam~~ newsletter :)
